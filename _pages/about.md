<!-- I am an adjunct senior lecturer working with Scientia Professor [Jingling Xue](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling) at School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of New South Wales. -->

I am working at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/) as a Senior Staff Engineer and Professoriate Senior Engineer. Additionally, I am an Adjunct Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) ([UNSW personal website](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pengd/)) and an Adjunct Professorate Researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I also serve as an Industrial PhD Mentor at Zhejiang University.

I earned my PhD degree from UNSW under supervised by Scientia Professor [Jingling Xue](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling). And then I worked as a Research Associate at [Compiler Research Group](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~corg/) and cooperatively developed an inter-procedural dependence analysis tool [SVF](http://svf-tools.github.io/SVF/) that is maintained by [Dr. Yulei Sui](https://yuleisui.github.io/).

Before joining Ant, I worked at Huawei as a Technical Expert of AI compiler. During the period, I am the founder of MindSpore/AKG ([GitHub](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg), [Gitee](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg)) which is an open-sourced AI compiler for Huawei Ascend 910.

I lead the software engineering team responsible for maintaining and developing Ant Group's DevSecOps. Our primary focus lies in developing practical program analysis platforms tailored for complex and extensive industrial codebases. 

Recently, our team has been dedicated to integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-world industrial scenarios, aiming to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of software development. 
The pretrained code LLM, CodeFuse, which was trained by our team at AntGroup, has been open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/codefuse-ai)  and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai). The technical report has been published on [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06266). 
We also open-sourced [CodeFuse-Query](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-Query) that is a scalable datalog-based static program analyser to assist the CodeFuse pre-train.
