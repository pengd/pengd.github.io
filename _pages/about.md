<!-- I am an adjunct senior lecturer working with Scientia Professor [Jingling Xue](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling) at School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of New South Wales. -->

I am working at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/) as a Senior Staï¬€ Engineer of software security. Also I am an adjunct Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales ([UNSW](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/)) and an adjunct Researcher (Professor) at Chinese Academy Sciences([CAS](http://english.cas.cn/)).

Before joining Ant, I worked at Huawei as a Technical Expert of AI compiler. During the period, I am the founder of MindSpore/AKG ([GitHub](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg), [Gitee](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg)) which is an open-sourced AI compiler for Huawei Ascend 910.

I earned my PhD degree from UNSW under supervised by Scientia Professor [Jingling Xue](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling) and then worked as a Research Fellow at [Compiler Research Group](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~corg/) in UNSW. 


Research Interests
======
* Program Analysis, Software Engineering and Security: Building fundamental static and dynamic analysis techniques and tools to improve the reliability and security of modern software systems.
 <!-- Flow-Sensitivity, Context-Sensitivity, Field-Sensitivity. More efficient, scalable and precise alias analysis algorithms for bug detection on multi-threaded practical problems.  -->
* Compilation Techniques for Heterogeneous Systems: High-level programming language design and implementation for heterogeneous systems. Compiler optimizations for lower-lever native heterogeneous languages such as CUDA, OpenCL. Automatic parallelization and performance optimization for heterogeneous systems.
* Parallel Programming & Optimisation: Fine-grained parallel algorithm for iterative algorithms, GPGPU and CUDA optimization, MPI process optimizing mapping for hierarchical multi-core clusters.


News
======
My team is looking for self-motivated technical experts, who are interested in program analysis, software security.

* 2020-07: Our paper "Optimizing the Memory Hierarchy by Compositing Automatic Transformations on Computations and Data" is accepted by MICRO-53.
* 2020-06: Our AKG is open-sourced. ([GitHub](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg), [Gitee](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg)).
