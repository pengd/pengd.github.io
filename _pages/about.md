<!-- I am an adjunct senior lecturer working with Scientia Professor [Jingling Xue](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling) at School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of New South Wales. We also open-sourced [CodeFuse-Query](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-Query) that is a scalable datalog-based static program analyser to assist the CodeFuse pre-train.
-->

<!-- I am working at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/) as a Senior Staff Engineer and leading the Intelligent Platform Engineering (IPE) team. Additionally, I am an Adjunct Associate Professor at [the University of New South Wales, Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/peng-di). I also serve as an Industrial PhD Mentor at Zhejiang University.

I earned my PhD degree from UNSW under supervised by IEEE Fellow, Scientia Professor [Jingling Xue](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling). And then I worked as a Research Associate at [Compiler Research Group](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~corg/) and cooperatively developed a program analyser [SVF](http://svf-tools.github.io/SVF/) over LLVM.

Before joining Ant, I worked at Huawei as a Technical Expert of AI compiler. During the period, I am the founder of MindSpore/AKG ([GitHub](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg), [Gitee](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg)) which is an open-sourced AI compiler for Huawei Ascend 910.

At Ant Group, our IPE team is dedicated to advancing software development and operations by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-world industrial applications. To support this mission, we are proud to share several major open-source contributions.

<li>CodeFuse: Our foundational pretrained code LLM, designed to enhance coding effectiveness. <a href="https://github.com/codefuse-ai">[GitHub]</a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/codefuse-ai">[HuggingFace]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06266">[Technical report]</a></li>

<li>Ling-Coder-Lite: is Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) code LLM, built on the Ant Ling-MoE architecture. <a href="https://github.com/codefuse-ai/Ling-Coder-Lite">[GitHub]</a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-lite">[HuggingFace]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17793">[Technical report]</a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-SFT">[SFT dataset]</a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-DPO">[DPO dataset]</a></li>

<li>CodeFuse-CGM: is a graph-based framework for software engineering tasks that employs a repository-level code graph to capture structural context. CGM-72B-V1.2 has achieved a leading 44.00% resolve rate on the SWE-Bench-Lite. <a href="https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-CGM">[Github]</a> <a href="https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-lite">[HuggingFace]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16901">[Technical report]</a></li>

<li>OpenDeRisk: Beyond models, we have also open-sourced OpenDeRisk, an AI-native risk intelligence system. It empowers your application to act as a 24/7 risk-aware manager, delivering continuous and comprehensive protection.<a href="https://github.com/derisk-ai/OpenDerisk">[Github]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13561">[Technical report]</a></li> -->

    <h2>Experience & Key Projects</h2>

    <h3><a href="https://www.antgroup.com/" target="_blank">Ant Group</a> (2020 &ndash; Present)</h3>
    <p>
        As the head of the IPE team, my focus has been on building tangible products and systems that redefine software engineering at an enterprise scale.

    <h3>Huawei (2017 &ndash; 2020)</h3>
    <p>
        At Huawei's 2012 Labs, I led the <strong>from-scratch development of MindSpore/AKG</strong>, an AI compiler for Huawei's Ascend AI chips. My work on optimizing computational efficiency through advanced compilation techniques was instrumental in its <strong>successful commercialization</strong>. I also played a key role in open-sourcing MindSpore to foster a vibrant developer ecosystem.
