Ling-Coder-Lite, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/Ling-Coder-Lite) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-lite). This model is based on the Ant Ling-MoE architecture. Additionally, the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17793), [SFT dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-SFT) and [DPO dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-DPO) are also openly accessible.

MindSpore/AKG: also known as the Automatic Kernel Generator, is a component of the MindSpore framework, which is an open-source machine learning (ML) platform developed by Huawei. AKG plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of neural network operations on various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and specialized AI accelerators like Ascend.
([GitHub](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg), [Gitee](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/akg)) which is an open-sourced AI compiler for Huawei Ascend 910.

SVF (Static Value-Flow Analysis Framework) is a prominent open-source tool designed for static program analysis. It is widely used in software engineering and programming language research to analyze how data values flow throughout a program. By providing powerful static analysis capabilities, SVF enables developers and researchers to better understand program behavior, detect software vulnerabilities, optimize compilers, and improve program verification.
