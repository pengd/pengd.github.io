<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>CGM is a graph-based framework for software engineering tasks that employs a repository-level code graph to capture structural context and a four-step R4 chain (Rewriter, Retriever, Reranker, Reader) to resolve issues. Starting with a rewritten query from the original issue, CGM retrieves a code subgraph, prioritizes critical files via reranking, and generates a code patch using a graph-aware Reader, combining heuristic retrieval with machine learning for efficient, context-aware solutions.</p>
