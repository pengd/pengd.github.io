SVF (Static Value-Flow Analysis Framework) is a prominent open-source tool designed for static program analysis. It is widely used in software engineering and programming language research to analyze how data values flow throughout a program. By providing powerful static analysis capabilities, SVF enables developers and researchers to better understand program behavior, detect software vulnerabilities, optimize compilers, and improve program verification.
