<span>
<div>
<p>CGM is a graph-based framework for software engineering tasks that employs a repository-level code graph to capture structural context and a four-step R4 chain (Rewriter, Retriever, Reranker, Reader) to resolve issues. Starting with a rewritten query from the original issue, CGM retrieves a code subgraph, prioritizes critical files via reranking, and generates a code patch using a graph-aware Reader, combining heuristic retrieval with machine learning for efficient, context-aware solutions.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the updated version of the CGM-72B-V1.2. This new model has achieved a remarkable 44.00% resolve rate on the SWE-Bench-Lite leaderboard, marking a significant improvement in its performance and capabilities.</p>
<p>CGM has been open-sourced on <a href="https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-CGM">Github</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI/Ling-Coder-lite">HuggingFace</a>. The report is on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16901">https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16901</a>.</p>

SVF (Static Value-Flow Analysis Framework) is a prominent open-source tool designed for static program analysis. It is widely used in software engineering and programming language research to analyze how data values flow throughout a program. By providing powerful static analysis capabilities, SVF enables developers and researchers to better understand program behavior, detect software vulnerabilities, optimize compilers, and improve program verification. <a href="http://svf-tools.github.io/SVF/">GitHub</a>.
